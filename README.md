# something

**It's something, I don't know what to add now, I will be using this file to keep track of advancements and stuff to work on, bye and see you later!**

## Important Note

School is back and I will be unable to work on it as much, the project will still be updated but the intervals will be longer, maybe less bigger updates but I will still be working,
Here is a list of things that should be done first:

- Arrows inside of the .bottom-bar element to go to the previous or next page, also change the inside of URL-bar based on the ?page url parameter
- Remove the app-window--pastel on the right when the screen is too small and also increase the width of app-window--XP if app-window--pastel is removed
- Make the button of app-window actually do something like closing the app-window or hiding it
- Create or style the about and credits page

**And if I don't make any update for weeks or months or even reply to messages, I either went into conversion therapy unwillingly, killed myself, lost access to technology but it's a bit unlikely, so stay safe and take care**
Thanks for reading!
